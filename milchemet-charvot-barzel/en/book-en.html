<h2 id="the-cursed-saturday-day-1-of-the-war-oct-7-2023">The Cursed
Saturday, Day 1 of the War (Oct 7, 2023):</h2>
<h4 id="the-big-party-starts-without-us.">The Big Party Starts Without
Us.</h4>
<p>Sukkot. We’re at the tail end of a week-long jeep trip in Romania.
They started the party and didn’t even bother waiting for us.</p>
<p>On the seventh and final day of the trip. Rockets, hostages, dead,
and more bad tidings.</p>
<p>Anat wakes up in the morning, in Romania, and sees Home Front Command
alerts. And we’re abroad. Surreal!</p>
<p>I decide to take down the flag from our jeep (in Romania). So we
won’t be identified as Israelis abroad.</p>
<p>Idan calls and tells us we really don’t understand what’s happening
back home.</p>
<p>Idan says the world has never seen anything like this.</p>
<p>Idan tells us the border with Gaza has been “updated.”</p>
<p>For the worse. (Every time I read this sentence that I wrote,
something rises in my throat.)</p>
<p>That three IDF bases have evaporated. That the bases are now burned,
and under Hamas control.</p>
<p>That kibbutzim were burned and emptied. And the residents had already
“relocated” to Gaza. (Hostages.)</p>
<p>In my opinion, Idan got confused and watched season 19 of Fauda.</p>
<p>Our feeling: bewilderment. We’re abroad. Far away. We feel like we’re
missing a dimension. We are so faaaaaar from everything.</p>
<p>Idan says it’s Yom Kippur all over again.</p>
<p>And I’m sure Idan is exaggerating.</p>
<p>It’s Saturday. Idan was called up. That’s unusual. He takes the car
and parks it near his unit. Writes “IDF” on it so he won’t get a ticket.
Anat asks that we stay in Romania a few more days.</p>
<p>But I feel too deep a belonging to the country. Being Jewish also
means not abandoning ship when it’s hard.</p>
<p>The airline cancels our flight home. And then reinstates it as a
regular flight.</p>
<p>After emotional ordeals <a
href="https://edenguy.wixsite.com/blog/post/%D7%98%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%94-155">[but
that’s for another post]</a> we arrive back home.</p>
<p>There were no sirens for us today.</p>
<p>Anat and the kids sleep in the safe room.</p>

<h2 id="day-2-of-the-war-the-hardest-day">Day 2 of the War (The Hardest
Day)</h2>
<p>I feel like that kid in first grade who didn’t come to school on the
first day, and all year long he feels like he missed something, and
asks: “So, what happened on the first day?”</p>
<p>We hear that lookout soldiers from the Gaza Division were locked in a
room, set on fire, and then shot to confirm the kill. Just to be sure. I
wonder who they learned that from.</p>
<p>Sapir, my lookout soldier, tells me there was a cyber attack on the
cameras.</p>
<p>The lookout soldiers had no visual feed.</p>
<p>And when the cameras came back online, the lookout soldiers saw piles
of terrorists crossing the separation fence.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was also a cyber attack on the
communications.</p>
<p>The lookout soldiers couldn’t call for backup because the comms were
under attack.</p>
<p>The rest is history.</p>
<p>Sapir completed the lookout soldiers’ course six months ago.</p>
<p>Sapir was assigned to a posting. She could just as easily have been
posted in Gaza.</p>
<p>The odds terrify me.</p>
<p>In a parallel universe, I have a daughter held hostage in Gaza right
now.</p>
<p>Or worse.</p>
<p>We hold an all-hands meeting at work with the entire Israeli
site.</p>
<p>People pour out what’s on their hearts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’m waiting for my reserve call-up order. And I’m getting
assignments from my managers. And what if I die in combat? No one at
work will know I fell in battle. People in the office won’t see me for a
few weeks and will simply forget I existed.</p></li>
<li><p>Will the company keep paying our salaries? Even after a month or
two of fighting, when we’re not productive? How will we pay for daycare
and the mortgage?</p></li>
<li><p>I have meetings with clients. Today I joined a meeting, but they
told me the meeting was canceled because my client is being held captive
in Gaza.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not a single eye stays dry in this conversation.</p>
<p>It’s horrible and devastating.</p>
<p>I’ve never experienced emotions this intense.</p>
<p>Maybe on 9/11.</p>
<p>After this devastating call, I phone Idan. Tell him about what came
up in the meeting. Can’t stop the tears. Crying to him on the phone.</p>
<p>This is the hardest day for me emotionally.</p>
<p>A child shouldn’t see his father break down.</p>
<p>Or maybe he should?</p>
<p>The news asks us to stay locked in our homes — terrorists in pickup
trucks are roaming the country’s roads.</p>
<p>They found a pickup with terrorists a kilometer and a half from our
house.</p>
<p>I cover the windows facing the street with cardboard. So no light is
visible from outside.</p>
<p>These are things my grandfather did in the War of Independence. When
they were bombed from the air. Blackout.</p>
<p>Home Front Command issues an unusual announcement that I’m sure
doesn’t instill any excess confidence in any household in Israel.</p>
<p>“Unusual announcement” to citizens: Home Front Command is calling on
people tonight to stock up on dry food, water, and additional supplies
for 72 hours. The call is addressed to all citizens.</p>
<p>These are the instructions:</p>
<p>◾ Water supply of 3 liters per person per day, for 72 hours</p>
<p>◾ Stock of dry and preserved food</p>
<p>◾ Battery-powered lighting or flashlight</p>
<p>◾ Means to receive alerts and updates — battery-powered radio and
portable chargers for mobile phones</p>
<p>◾ Medications</p>
<p>◾ First aid kit</p>
<p>◾ Personal documents, IDs, and cash</p>
<p>Portugal will allow Israelis to apply for refugee visas. I’m
considering applying.</p>
<p>The family is on high alert.</p>
<p>I prepare 400 liters of water.</p>
<p>Going to fill up a full tank of gas in the family car.</p>
<p>High alert for real.</p>
<p>Lior writes a letter to the soldiers.</p>
<p>I call Sapir. Sapir updates me that intruders breached settlements in
her neighboring sector. I see black before my eyes. I’m not okay.</p>
<p>I’m in a panic. Will they copy-paste the attack on the lookout
soldiers in Gaza?</p>
<p>The stress level keeps rising and rising. Bubbling. About to burst.
Hard to contain the terror.</p>
<p>I call Idan. Idan says if the media is telling people to stock up on
batteries and candles, it means Hezbollah from the north and Iran too —
they’re all invited to the party.</p>
<p>The stress level reaches boiling point.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to do with myself.</p>
<p>It’s only the second day. And the future doesn’t look rosy at
all.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be better. I’m lying to myself.</p>
<p>Anat and the kids sleep in the safe room.</p>
<p>Today there were 3 sirens.</p>

<h2 id="day-3-of-the-war">Day 3 of the War</h2>
<p>Every few hours I check in with Idan. And with Sapir.</p>
<p>Sapir tells me they sent all the regular-service soldiers south.</p>
<p>Two reservists are guarding them.</p>
<p>That’s it. Now I’m calm…</p>
<p>Sapir can’t get in touch with her friend from the lookout soldiers’
course, from the Gaza Division.</p>
<p>Anat and I already know what happened to her. But we don’t want to
tell.</p>
<p>Sapir gives us a name, and begs us to find out what happened to
her.</p>
<p>Sapir doesn’t know a thing about the fate of the lookout
soldiers.</p>
<p>Our hearts ache. And we don’t tell her that her friend was captured
by Hamas.</p>
<p>Endless lines of people wanting to donate blood. Warms the heart.
Eden is standing in line to donate too.</p>
<p>Driving to a gas station to stock up on more water. And more dry
food.</p>
<p>I prepare a wooden plank for the safe room door, so it can’t be
opened from outside.</p>
<p>The kids don’t understand what it’s for.</p>
<p>I’d rather they keep not understanding.</p>
<p>But I’m not satisfied with this plank. It’s not reliable.</p>
<p>Today the siren caught me mid-set. Interrupted my workout. This has
gone too far.</p>
<p>My cousin Stacey, from Philadelphia, pops up and demands updates.
What’s happening in Israel? How far are we from ground zero?</p>
<p>I open a family WhatsApp group with her and drop updates.</p>
<p>She’s simply horrified. Invites all of us to come to her. There’s
room.</p>
<p>Anat and the kids sleep in the safe room.</p>
<p>Today there were two sirens.</p>

<p>Day 4 of the War</p>
<p>Idan came home today to return the car, changed his underwear, and
ran back to his unit. Spent ten minutes at home.</p>
<p>He says he doesn’t understand how we’re just sitting at home waiting
for things to pass. How we’re not contributing. Contributing to the war
effort, doing something, fighting.</p>
<p>Just sitting at home waiting for better times. He’s at his keyboard
19 hours a day. Maybe 20. For a week straight. Fighting. He’s surrounded
by people of action 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Suddenly he comes home and sees people staring/gazing at walls.</p>
<p>Meaning, he understands we’re civilians and nothing is expected of
us, but he’s been in 180% CPU mode for a week, and suddenly he sees his
two brain-dead parents at home, and it grates. The contrast.</p>
<p>I tell Idan I wanted to cook 100 hot meals and bring them to Sapir,
to her unit. But she said there’s enough food in the mess hall.</p>
<p>I ended up thinking about what Idan said, and I decide to volunteer
to help farmers who got their reserve call-up orders.</p>
<p>There’s a shortage of working hands in agriculture. Produce isn’t
being collected from the fields. Breaks your heart. Good food. Going to
waste.</p>
<p>I’d like to help where it’s really needed. In the communities near
the Gaza border. But Anat vetoes it.</p>
<p>I contact Leket Israel. And schedule for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sapir receives a photo of her friend shackled in Hamas captivity. Our
hearts break — that this is how she finds out about her friend.</p>
<p>Gaalit, a friend from elementary school, calls today to say that
Asaf, a classmate, received word that his daughter — a soldier — was
shot in her sleep at the Gaza Division.</p>
<p>Asaf Groman is absolutely shattered.</p>

<p>Day 5 of the War</p>
<p>Heading out early in the morning for shopping.</p>
<p>The supermarket shelves are pretty empty.</p>
<p>No deliveries, no workers at the supermarket, no merchandise — just
cashiers.</p>
<p>The shelves are empty. Like Eastern Europe under communism.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a complaint was filed with the police by a
neighborhood resident about a suspicious man walking outside the
neighborhood, in the sand dunes, with a large backpack.</p>
<p>That’s me going out for rucking (a large 30-kilo backpack, walking
through the sand hills near home). A police car stops me and asks for
details. They release me immediately, of course. But you can learn
something about the nervousness and anxiety of the residents.</p>
<p>When I tell Sapir about the incident, she cracks up laughing.</p>
<p>Glad I managed to make her laugh.</p>
<p>Anat prints out mandalas and colors them with the kids.</p>
<p>I share my struggles with my boss, tell him I’m not as productive as
before. He receives it with complete understanding.</p>
<p>Sapir tells us the girls at the command post decided to observe
Shabbat in memory and honor of the lookout soldiers who were massacred
and kidnapped.</p>
<p>Not to try reaching her on Saturday because her phone will be off.
They’re observing.</p>
<p>That’s all I need. For Sapir to start becoming religious.</p>
<p>I imagine myself going to Osher Ad to buy disposable dishes, because
otherwise Sapir won’t agree to sit with us at the Shabbat table.</p>
<p>That’s all I need!!!</p>
<p>Sapir reassures me it’s a one-time thing.</p>
<p>I’m not reassured. Every newly religious person starts with a
one-time thing.</p>
<p>I had an idea for an app.</p>
<pre><code>Instead of asking everyone if they&#39;re okay after a rocket siren,
I sign up,
mark who I want to know is safe.
After a siren, I mark that I&#39;m okay.
Then I can see which friends/family are okay, and who hasn&#39;t responded.
There&#39;ll be a nice matrix that slowly, asynchronously fills up green.
And after 5 minutes we get a notification about who didn&#39;t respond.
Simple pub-sub.
(The app would also indicate who has low battery or is out of range and therefore didn&#39;t respond. And each user would need to approve their followers. Privacy.)
I thought of this 15 years ago, during the suicide bombings.
But now it&#39;s more relevant.
One workday to build this.
It&#39;ll be a hit.
React, AWS.</code></pre>
<p>Friends are excited about the idea. Anat less so.</p>
<p>Today there were two sirens.</p>
<p>Anat and the kids sleep in the safe room.</p>

<p>Day 6 of the War</p>
<p>Waking up at 3 AM. Can’t fall asleep. Sleep eludes me.</p>
<p>Texting with my friend Barel.</p>
<p>He asks if I’ll include the conversations with him in my war
diary.</p>
<p>So here it is. Including.</p>
<p>Barel is patrolling his community with a weapon. That’s why he’s
available at 3 AM.</p>
<p>I ask him how Mizrahi Jews are so warm, loving, wholehearted, but
Arabs are so cruel and vicious.</p>
<p>It takes him a long time to answer, and I worry he might be offended
that I’m comparing Mizrahi Jews to Arabs.</p>
<p>But I actually meant it in a positive way.</p>
<p>Barel tells about a Lag BaOmer show seared in his memory from
childhood, where an Arab guy tortured pigeons — set them on fire, stuck
firecrackers in them.</p>
<p>Cruel, the Arabs are.</p>
<p>Barel sends a current photo of himself. From his night patrol.</p>
<p>And I recommend he shave urgently, so a Border Police patrol doesn’t
stop him.</p>
<p>I join the “Brothers of the Farm” forum. Looking for volunteer
opportunities in agriculture. They ask if I can help with milking.</p>

<p>Day 7</p>
<p>07:00 — Adi (my sister) calls.</p>
<p>By the hour, I understand something’s happening.</p>
<p>Adi, in a trembling voice, tells me that her daughter, Mai, who’s
been in Australia for a year and a half, has decided to come back to
Israel to fight. Her home for two years and eight months (during her
regular service) was destroyed. (Gaza Division.) And she can’t stand by
and be passive.</p>
<p>Adi is terrified. Trying to convince her not to come.</p>
<p>But Mai has made up her mind.</p>
<p>Dad calls. We talk.</p>
<p>Dad — “How did we not learn anything from the Yom Kippur War?”</p>
<p>Me — I can promise you the Yom Kippur War will happen a third time,
to our grandchildren too, in 50 years. It’s impossible to hermetically
seal a border for 200 years. Things happen. And will happen.</p>
<p>Dad — I need to replace the Education Minister. Israeli children
don’t know history. How is it that my grandchildren don’t know history?
And why don’t my children know anything that happened before the year
2000?</p>
<p>Me — Getting annoyed, not in the mood to get lectured by someone who
fancies himself the next Education Minister, and I hang up.</p>
<p>They say dogs have become conditioned to the sirens and run first to
the safe room when a siren sounds.</p>
<p>Except Shuki, our dog, is half-deaf and doesn’t rush to any safe room
when a siren goes off.</p>
<p>Today there were two sirens.</p>
<p>Anat and Lior sleep in the safe room.</p>

<p>Day 9 of the War</p>
<p>Okay, today is really rainy. I call Leket Israel and schedule for
tomorrow. Tomorrow for sure.</p>
<p>I buy a bolt for the safe room door. Install the bolt. Replacing the
controversial wooden plank. Show Lior how to press rivets. Explain the
difference between a masonry drill bit and a metal drill bit.</p>
<p>The kids are learning remotely today. On Zoom.</p>
<p>Anat plays tons of board games and card games with the kids every
day.</p>
<p>She’s really enjoying it too. Making up for all the years she refused
to play games.</p>
<p>The kids are getting addicted to playing games with Anat.</p>
<p>Mai enlists.</p>
<p>Today two sirens.</p>
<p>Anat sleeps with Lior in the safe room.</p>

<p>Day 10 of the War</p>
<p>Today is the day I’m a farmer for a day.</p>
<p>I’m going to help with agriculture.</p>
<p>A huge field in Rishon LeZion. Harvesting kohlrabi.</p>
<p>There are tons of volunteers. From all over the country. All ages.
Warms the heart to see the spirit of volunteering among the people.</p>
<p>We’re asked to pick the kohlrabi, remove the roots and leaves, fill a
bucket, and when the bucket is full, fill the large container. The
shipping container.</p>
<p>After three hours everyone is tired. But satisfied.</p>
<p>I come home and try to entertain Lior. We fill a large bowl with
water and lots of ice.</p>
<p>We dunk our heads in the bowl. This has many benefits. Activates the
parasympathetic nervous system, releases endorphins, boosts the immune
system.</p>
<p>Turns out there are cold receptors on the sides of the head. So
dunking your head in ice water is almost like an ice bath for the whole
body.</p>
<p>We both get brain freeze.</p>
<p>We also do a dead-hang challenge on the pull-up bar. Hanging for 100
seconds.</p>
<p>I survive 100 seconds. Barely. Lior manages a minute. Which is very
impressive.</p>
<p>Anat makes cheese and potato burekas with the kids.</p>
<p>I want to make chocolate balls with Lior, but we don’t have Petit
Beurre biscuits.</p>
<p>Another heartbreaking message from Sapir.</p>

<p>Day 11 of the War</p>
<p>Lior sends me to his school to bring back the books and notebooks he
left there before the war.</p>
<p>The school is deserted and empty. Like during Covid.</p>
<p>I buy Petit Beurre biscuits. Today we’ll make chocolate balls
together.</p>
<p>My friend Guri discovers that the terrorists who infiltrated Israel
11 days ago were drugged.</p>

<p>Day 12 of the War</p>
<p>Hamas announced today that a senior member of its military wing,
Ayman Nofal, was eliminated by the IDF in central Gaza — the
highest-ranking elimination so far. He was responsible for coordination
between the different battalions of terror organizations in the
Strip.</p>
<p>Today we got 7 sirens. Nofal’s elimination explains that.</p>
<p>At night, Lior has an anxiety attack. Trembling, shallow
breathing.</p>
<p>Anat works with him on breathing exercises.</p>

</div>
<p>I come across a security camera video from Kibbutz Be’eri. You can
see swarms of them entering — Muslims flooding in.</p>
<p>It looked like a public square in Gaza. Fighters, children, elderly,
disabled, teenagers. Everyone and everything.</p>
<p>It was like an annual field trip. Everyone crossed the border into
Israel, grabbed a little Jew as a souvenir to tie up in their living
room, and went back to Gaza, after abusing the local residents.</p>
<p>Day 13 of the War — Shuki learns to run with us to the safe room.</p>
<p>We’re not sure if the trigger is the siren, or if he sees all of us
running in a panic to the safe room.</p>
<p>We decide to test it.</p>
<p>Count down 3…2…1… and run together to the safe room.</p>
<p>Shuki sprints with us.</p>
<p>It’s official. The dog is deaf.</p>
<p>… Turns out there are several dozen Hamas terrorists roaming around
Israel.</p>
<p>Israeli Arabs are giving them food. And shelter.</p>
<p>If there’s something stressful… this is it.</p>

is the stuff my nightmares are made of</a>. Dozens of terrorists roaming
Israel.</p>
<p>Every few months this scene haunts me in a dream. Somehow at the end
of the dream I find myself fleeing for my life from armed
terrorists.</p>
<p>But now it’s real.</p>
<p>And there are testimonies from people who fought over the safe room
door handle for hours against determined terrorists on the other side of
the door.</p>
<p>And given all this, and the stress building up in me again after
calming down last week, I decide to upgrade the bolts on the safe
room.</p>
<p>I have one bolt, and I want to install three more.</p>
<p>That will buy me a little peace of mind.</p>
<p>I go to the neighborhood hardware store, but all the bolts are gone.
Go to ACE — the bolts aren’t heavy-duty enough.</p>
<p>Home Depot… same.</p>
<p>In the end I consult with Bar-El, my friend Barel who brings me
proper bolts, and together we install them.</p>

<p>Day 14 of the War</p>
<p>I’m considering getting a gun license.</p>
<p>These are insane times. I never thought I’d apply for a firearms
permit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t meet the requirements. I’m a marksman 02. The
criterion is 03. Or a frontline community.</p>
<p>I take comfort in the fact that Rishon LeZion will be a frontline
community within a week and a half. And then I’ll rush to get a firearms
permit.</p>
<p>Sapir has a ukulele. She’s boosting morale in her unit with her
ukulele.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/052.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Sapir tells us they were instructed to prepare mentally for 60 days
on base.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear to me how you can mentally prepare yourself
for something like that.</p>
<p>People are talking about Israeli Arabs walking around cities, various
cities. Tel Aviv too. Photographing houses.</p>
<p>Dozens of posts about it on Facebook.</p>

<p>The shekel is losing value.</p>
<p>Day 15 of the War</p>
<p>Today is a holiday at home.</p>
<p>Idan arrives for 24 hours of R&amp;R.</p>
<p>I pick him up at the train station.</p>
<p>Great joy. Finally the prodigal son returns home.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/054.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Idan shares his experiences from his unit.</p>
<p>Experiences like these I’m sure he won’t have anywhere else. At any
other time.</p>
<p>We have a Friday evening dinner in Idan’s honor.</p>
<p>We miss Sapir.</p>
<p>Today 3 missiles were fired from Yemen toward Israel. The front is
definitely heating up.</p>
<p>The launch of three missiles and 15 drones by the Houthis toward
Israel, and their interception by the American ship, are a realization
of last week’s threats and promises. However, the fire increases the
chance that Hezbollah will also join the war | Analysis</p>
<p>On day 13 of the war, Iran and the US entered it. Tehran almost
literally fulfilled their threats to expand the war to additional
fronts, and the Americans fulfilled their promise to assist Israel
operationally if needed — not with soldiers on the ground but by
intercepting missiles and drones launched by Iranian proxies from areas
not adjacent to Israel’s border.</p>
<p>American soldiers will not fight on the ground in Israel and for it,
but the US will help deal with missile barrages from the far flanks of
the radical Shiite axis.</p>
<p>Day 16 of the War</p>
<p>This morning we got a siren at 09:00 AM. That’s unusual.</p>
<p>It seems the IDF has taken control of the northern part of the Strip,
and they can only fire from the south.</p>
<p>We’re the new Tel Aviv. It seems they can no longer reach Tel Aviv.
We’re the northernmost target.</p>
<p>Our housekeeper says we’re too stressed, because there’s plenty of
time to get to the safe room.</p>
<p>Lior asks to join my workout routine in the yard.</p>
<p>We put on his favorite playlist and work out together. Arms day
today.</p>

<p>Steak and lobster. On the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald
Ford in the Mediterranean, steak and lobster were served last night. The
sailors know this meal is served on holidays — or to boost morale before
going into action.</p>

<p>Lior woke up tonight from a nightmare.</p>
<p>In his dream, he’s eating a cookie. A granola cookie he made with Mom
and Itai. In the dream, a siren goes off. And it’s a special siren that
only allows half a minute to the safe room, not a minute and a half.
Lior races to the safe room with the cookie in his mouth. Under the
pressure, Lior chokes on the dry cookie. Dad (me) performs the Heimlich
on him, saves him, and the cookie flies out of his throat. Mom sees the
cookie come out whole from Lior’s throat and faints. And then he woke
up.</p>
<p>Day 17 of the War</p>
<p>Waking up at 02:00 and can’t fall back asleep.</p>
<p>All my red lines have been crossed.</p>
<p>I don’t want to live here anymore.</p>
<p>We tried. We really tried.</p>

<p>Today is a happy day.</p>
<p>Sapir comes home for R&amp;R.</p>
<p>The small pleasures of life.</p>
<p>Sapir arrives at 14:00. And already needs to head back to base by
07:00 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I take her shopping. Restocking gear. Thermal undershirts, jacket,
socks. Ricochet gives us a coupon.</p>
<p>A fat coupon.</p>
<p>Sapir tells anecdotes.</p>
<p>She doesn’t seem to have changed.</p>
<p>Fairly normal behavior.</p>
<p>No post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>Even though she tells about her basic training deputy commander who
was murdered, and about lookout soldier friends who were killed or
kidnapped.</p>
<p>But it seems to wash over her without leaving residue.</p>
<p>I believe things will surface in years to come.</p>
<div class="image-solo">

<p>Day — I stop counting…</p>
<p>IQ in the general population distributes with a mean of 100 and a
standard deviation of 15.</p>
<p>In Gaza the mean is 85, with the same standard deviation.</p>
<p>That means, out of 2 million Gazans there are 120 guys with 145 IQ,
classified as geniuses.</p>
<p>I’m very worried about a ground invasion. I’m sure surprises are
waiting for us there that our bumbling intelligence services can’t
predict.</p>
<p>The 120 Gazan geniuses have surely planted traps for us.</p>
<p>Day follows day.</p>
<p>The despair grows by the day.</p>
<p>And I’m tired of updating the diary.</p>
<p>Anat and Lior still sleep in the safe room.</p>
<p>Oct 31 — Day 20 of the War</p>
<p>Waking up on the morning of October 31st. Rubbing my eyes and going
downstairs to the living room.</p>
<p>I see a chain of balloons hanging in the living room.</p>
<p>And I don’t quite understand what that’s about.</p>
<p>Oh, right. It’s my birthday today.</p>
<p>I forgot.</p>
<p>I was surprised.</p>
<p>Nice to get some attention.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/061.jpg" />
</div>
<p>In honor of my birthday I decide to go for a trail run in the open
fields.</p>
<p>Anat warns that they don’t intercept missiles over open fields.</p>
<p>I ignore her.</p>
<p>My sanity matters more.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/062.jpg" />
</div>
<p>At noon, after a work meeting, Lior calls me to come to the kitchen
for a moment. I arrive, and they sing Happy Birthday to me — there’s
even a cake.</p>
<p>Since I’m the only one who’s been going out shopping for the past
month — without knowing what for — I bought what was on the grocery
list: biscuits and cream cheese for a cheesecake.</p>
<p>They played me.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I drive to Decathlon, buy a red punching bag, hang
it in the yard, and write “HAMAS” on it in black marker.</p>
<p>Now the kids are letting out tons of aggression on Hamas. The
emotions from the past month, all the sirens, the frustration. It all
comes out in bare fists.</p>
<p>It’s a great thing. Great satisfaction, kicking Hamas.
Therapeutic.</p>

<p>Day 30 of the War</p>
<p>Sapir comes home for a day and a half. First time she’s been away
this long from the command post.</p>
<p>We feel whole again.</p>
<p>Sapir looks good. Looks really strong. The unbearably hard events
barely affected her.</p>
<p>I’m pleased.</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/065.jpg" />

<p>Idan sends me a message on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>What’s that suddenly about?</p>
<p>How am I suddenly regressing to day two of the war?</p>
<p>I’m back on high alert, replacing the water in the safe room.
Restocking supplies.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/069.jpg" />
</div>
<p>I’m spiraling again. Not sleeping well at night.</p>
<p>Where did Idan come up with this crap all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Trying to extract a few more details. But Idan is in a bunker.</p>
<p>Not a word.</p>
<p>And here’s another news item that reminds me of the Yom Kippur
War:</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the war with Hamas, Jordan announced it would
recall its ambassador to Israel for consultations.</p>
<p>The Houthi leader sends a threatening message to Israel. Abdul-Malik
al-Houthi, leader of the Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, said that “the
Yemeni people will not hesitate to declare jihad against Israel.”</p>
<p>Today, missile launches by the Houthis, the rebels from Yemen, toward
the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The match lit in Yemen could force Saudi Arabia and the US to get off
the fence.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt the front is heating up.</p>
<p>Who had even heard of these Houthis until today? Where did this come
from? Yemen? Is that even a real country?</p>
<p>For the first time ever near the Middle East: the largest and most
expensive warship in the world. 90 aircraft, 4,300 crew members, and
armed submarines: The US brings aircraft carriers near Israeli shores in
a show of support for the war against Hamas. The carrier “Ford,” the
largest and most expensive warship in the world, has already been
deployed in the Mediterranean, and next week the “Eisenhower” is also
expected to arrive.</p>

<p>American Salesforce grants its Israeli employees a war bonus.

<p>Nice to know they see us. That they’re thinking of us.</p>

<p>Anat can’t reach the safe room window to close it. So I install a
clothesline with a pulley that makes it easier to close the safe room
window.</p>
<p>Anat is not especially impressed.</p>
<p>Lior says he wants to join my workout routine.</p>
<p>One good thing comes out of this cursed war.</p>
<p>Lior joins me, and we work out together.</p>
<p>Lior has a good body. Solid. If he invests just a little in himself
and exercises, he turns into a beast.</p>

<p>Anat and I connect via Zoom with Cami the therapist.</p>
<p>She’s really great. In the session we gradually decide to leave the
safe room, leave the house — maybe the kids will go to Scouts, to
friends, to school. Cami really helped us.</p>
<p>I didn’t think one Zoom session could be this effective.</p>
<p>Anat’s mom comes for a brief visit and gets a taste of our safe

<p>Anat declares that tonight she will sleep in the bedroom, and Lior
will sleep in his own room.</p>
<p>Excitement. After 30 days of sleeping in the safe room.</p>
<p>In honor of the occasion we got two nighttime sirens. One at 21:00.
And one at 22:00.</p>
<p>Lior declares he slept great.</p>
<p>He made Anat swear that if there’s a siren, she’ll wake him up first
and foremost, and not forget about him.</p>

<p>The Fifth Week of the War — Noa’s Week</p>
<h4 id="wednesday-nov-14.-anats-birthday.">Wednesday, Nov 14. Anat’s
Birthday.</h4>
<p>Today the terrible day we feared has arrived.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/092.png" />
</div>
<p>In the morning, Sapir sends me a snuff video published by Hamas,
showing that Noa Marciano was killed by IDF bombings.</p>
<p>Sapir is afraid to watch the video and asks me to watch it and tell
her what’s shown.</p>
<p>After watching, I tell Sapir I think it’s all cynical Hamas
propaganda. Blatantly unbelievable.</p>
<p>About two hours later, Anat comes running to me, crying. She found
out Noa Marciano was murdered in Hamas captivity.</p>
<p>The worst has happened.</p>
<p>What a lovely birthday we arranged for Anat.</p>
<p>We call Sapir in fear and trembling. We deliver the terrible
news.</p>
<p>Sapir tells us that Noa wrote her a letter during basic training and
asked her not to read it until after basic training was over.</p>
<p>Sapir forgot about it until today.</p>
<p>The whole family is now searching for the small black notebook where
Noa Marciano wrote an important letter to Sapir.</p>
<p>Can’t find it :(</p>
<p>Anat and I walk around all day like zombies.</p>
<p>No desire for anything.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what our Sapir is going through.</p>
<p>This is a very hard day for me. For us. One of the hardest.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/093.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Since there’s no body, the family sits shiva without a funeral.</p>
<p>We arrange to go with Sapir to pay a condolence visit in Modi’in on
Thursday.</p>
<p>It seems the hostage families’ march headed to Jerusalem will pass
through there right on Thursday at noon.</p>
<div class="image-solo">
  <img src="D:/dev/blog/milchemet-charvot-barzel/images/094.png" />
</div>
<p>Hamas, a terrorist organization, dealt the Israeli superpower the
hardest military blow in its history. The deception was flawless. The
intelligence failure was total. The results were catastrophic, and only
the magnitude of humiliation exceeded the magnitude of failure. Israel
was within reach of a historic peace deal with Saudi Arabia, which would
have completed the circle of peace with the Sunni axis, locked the
Palestinians in a black box, and thrown it into the sea. Instead, they
nearly threw us into the sea. The transition we underwent on that
Saturday, October 7th, is one of the sharpest in history. In an instant,
the Israeli empire transformed from a smug, arrogant, and confident
superpower — one that strikes Iran, Syria, and everything in between,
bestows its intelligence on all its suitors, sets the pace for the
entire Middle East, and stands as a beacon of technology, power, and
intelligence to the world — into a shipwreck tossed among the waves, a
nation in existential panic, citizens trying to scrounge themselves a
pistol or a knife to sleep with under their pillow at night, even if
they live in the heart of Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Time freezes. The routine of each day feels like October 7th.</p>

<h4 id="thursday">Thursday</h4>
<p>Today we drove with Sapir to Modi’in. To the home of Noa Marciano’s
family. To pay a condolence call.</p>
<p>Her mother makes an impression of a very remarkable woman.</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>We meet a woman there who came to offer condolences. She tells us she
has two daughters. One a lookout soldier, held hostage in Gaza. And the
other participating in the hostage families’ march.</p>
<p>Anat hugs her in tears.</p>
<p>There’s not much to say.</p>
<p>They set up a mourning tent where dozens of men wearing kippas and
rabbis gather, recite Kaddish, and discuss the Torah portion.</p>
<p>It irks me, this whole thing. The “strengthening of faith” during
times of crisis.</p>
<p>We go up to Noa’s childhood room. Sapir goes through her belongings,
photographs the correspondence between Noa and her commander.</p>
<p>The situation is not easy for anyone.</p>
<p>On the side sit two large blue crates adorned with the Israeli flag —
Noa’s personal belongings, sent by the IDF to her parents.</p>
<p>Heartrending.</p>

<h4 id="friday">Friday</h4>
<p>We wake up on Friday morning, and here comes the news:</p>
<p>Day 42 of fighting | The IDF has returned the body of soldier Noa
Marciano, who was killed in Hamas captivity, to Israel.</p>
<p>So there will be a funeral after all.</p>
<p>The body was found yesterday near Shifa Hospital, a day after finding
the body of Yehudit Weiss from Kibbutz Be’eri. Three Palestinians were
killed in an IDF strike in Jenin; the force surrounded the hospital in
the city. Blinken spoke with Gantz and with the foreign ministers of

<p>Sapir drives to Modi’in to attend the funeral, to pay her last
respects.</p>
<p>Lior’s class sent blessings to soldiers. Warms the heart. The
soldiers are happy.</p>

<p>Day 78 of the war.</p>
<p>Today, the Noa Marciano memorial path was inaugurated. Sapir went to
Modi’in for the dedication ceremony.</p>
<p>The city of Modi’in has a tradition: every fallen soldier who is a
native of the city gets a street named after them.</p>

<p>A friend of mine is hospitalized this week at Ichilov, for emergency
surgery.</p>
<p>He says every hour and a half helicopters arrive from the south to
the hospital helipad, carrying critically wounded.</p>
<p>Dozens, or more, wounded arrive each day. The hospital is
overwhelmed. Closes its ER. An extremely rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The least I can do is donate a pint of blood.</p>
