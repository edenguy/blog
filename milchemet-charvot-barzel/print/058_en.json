As crazy as it sounds, because until a month ago I was really doing well here.\nBut everyone was right, all the tech workers who left, it's no longer good here. Everything is rotten. Everything.\nLet's start over in California.\nThere the kids and we can heal from the traumas.\nLet's start planning.",
